# 03-Password-Generator

In this project, I created a random password generator with JavaScript that can be between the length of 8 - 128 characters according to user's preferences.

Then users are are presented with a seiries of prompts asking for thier preferences about if they want to use upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters in their password.  Users can choose 1, 2, 3, or all four types of characters:

After choosing the number and character types for their password, the client hits the "Generate Password" button and a random password corresponding to their chosen criteria shows up in the text box.

This was deifintely a challenging assignment for someone new to Javascript like me. But it was also very rewarding as it gave me a good foundational knowledge of this powerful coding laguage.
